# MorseCode_byChatGPT

share the encoder and decoder for morse in python. 
User will share the input as text and the output should be encoded to morse code. 
For decoding also the morse code will be the input while output will be the text. 
Give option for either encoding or decoding.

Here is some Python code that will encode a given text string into Morse code and decode a given Morse code string into text. 
The user can choose to either encode or decode by selecting the appropriate option.


include the special characters as well for above codes

Certainly! Here is an updated version of the encode and decode functions that includes support for special characters:


i got error Exception has occurred: KeyError '' on text += morse_code_rev[code]

It looks like you are encountering a KeyError when trying to decode a Morse code string. 
This error occurs when the dictionary morse_code_rev does not contain a key for the code element being looked up.

One possible reason for this error is that the Morse code string contains characters that are not part of the Morse code alphabet. 
These characters are not included in the dictionary, so when they are encountered during decoding, a KeyError is raised.

To fix this error, you could modify the decode function to check for invalid characters and skip them. Here is an example of how this could be done:
